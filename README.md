# the_snake_game
So, to recreate my childhood, I created this game ->Make the snake devour the food to avoid collapsing.

Here we have three files, named snake.py, main.py, and food.py.
 
-> main.py is the key file which import all the other files. <br/>
-> score.py is used to handle the score.<br/>
-> snake.py is used for the building of the snake.<br/>
-> food.py is used for generating the food.<br/>
